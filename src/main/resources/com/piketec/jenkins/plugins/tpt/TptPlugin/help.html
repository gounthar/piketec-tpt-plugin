  The "Execute TPT test cases" build step can run in two modes.
  <ul>
    <li>Just execute the tests within this Job. The given values will be used to create a command
        that will be executed. This command could be typed into the command line and would work.
    </li>
    <li>Use this Job as a Master. In this mode the TPT RMI API is used to read the test cases that
        must be executed. For every test case a slave job is started and parameters are provided
        that can be used by the "Execute TPT tests slave" build step. The slaves copy their reults
        back to the master and the master will aggregate the test results.
    </li>
  </ul>
  The master mode can be activated and configured by clicking on the "Advanced" button.
