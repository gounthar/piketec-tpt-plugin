  The "Execute TPT test cases" build step can run in two modes.
  <ul>
    <li>Just execute the tests within this Job. The given values will be used to create a command
        that will be executed. This command could be typed into the command line and would work.
    </li>
    <li>Use this job as a distributing job. In this mode the TPT RMI API is used to read the test
        cases that must be executed. For every test case an worker job is started and parameters are
        provided that can be used by the "Execute TPT tests as a worker for a TPT distributing job"
        build step. The worker jobs copy their reults back to the distributing job and the
        distributing job will aggregate the test results.
    </li>
  </ul>
  The distributing mode can be activated and configured by clicking on the "Advanced" button.
