    The first field of the Validation-Set is a path to a TPT file.
    The second field of the Validation-Set is an execution configuration.

    Example: We have a folder &quot;run&quot;.
    In this folder are the tpt file &quot;run.tpt&quot;, our reference folder
    called &quot;refdata&quot; and after running &quot;run.tpt&quot; a folder called &quot;testdata&quot;.
    Below &quot;refdata&quot; and &quot;testdata&quot; we have a folder with the name of our tpt file, 
    here &quot;run&quot; and below there a folder with the configuration as name, e.g. &quot;foo&quot;.
