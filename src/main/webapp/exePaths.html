    The path of the tpt.exe file on Jenkins (add &quot;\tpt.exe&quot; at the end). You can specifiy
    multiple paths as a comma seperated list. In that case the first existing path found will be used.<br/>
    
	You can specify either an absolute path or a path relative to the workspace. <br/>
	
	If this is a distributed build, so if you use an agent to execute this task, make sure the path is in 
	the context of the agent machine and not the controller machine.
