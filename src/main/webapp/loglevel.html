    Set the log level of the error details for failed JUnit test results. TPT generates log entries
    of different severity and if a test fails the generated JUnit result will contain the logs. If
    you want to reduce the size of the JUnit files you can choose a severity and only messages with
    equal or higher severity will be written into the file.
