TPT is a testing and verification tool for embedded control systems. TPT can test MATLAB Simulink
or dSpace TargetLink models, ETAS ASCET models, C-Code or test via MiL, SiL, PiL and HiL. The
[PikeTec TPT Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/PikeTec+TPT+Plugin) allows users to
execute tests modeled in [TPT (Time Partition Testing)](http://www.piketec.com/en/2/tpt.html) via
Jenkins. An xml file can be generated in JUnit format for the reporting of test results.
